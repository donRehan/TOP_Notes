#MDN DSL Practice

In this challenge we want to make a simple shopping list example that 
allows you to dynamically add items to the list using a form input and 
button. When you add an item to the input and press the button:

    The item should appear in the list.
    Each item should be given a button that can be pressed to delete that item off the list.
    The input should be emptied and focused ready for you to enter another item.

#### Code serves as a TODO list too 
I can also use this code as a daily todo minimal list
as it does the job of a daily todo list greatly.
IE add items , delete them and show them listed in a list beneath
each other.
