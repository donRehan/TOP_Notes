Since previously we learned that a website consists of boxes
Then we learned that boxes in this case are either inline or block.

Some elements would have their default display as block

```css
display: block;
```
> This would cause new elements to be stacked as blocks on top of each others.

Inline however as the name suggests they dont start on new lines instead 
they appear in line with elements they are placed with

Middle ground :: The inline-block
This makes elements behave like inline but with block margin and paddings

#### Divs and Spans

###### Div
> Divs are by default block element Hence allows us to stack on top of 
each other by default.

###### span
> Spans however are inline by default and allows us to stack elements 
next to each others.
