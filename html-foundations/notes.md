# Html 
Think of html as big containers where a container starts like this 
```
<container> </container>
```

We want to add an object inside then will add inside the container the object suppose it is a train

```
<container> <train></train> </container>
```
> Note:
> if we have <container some-property="x"> Think of this as the property again of the container as lets say the color
> the type of component used

and so on.

## Step 1 
## of creating any html file is declaring the file type and which is always just 

```html 
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

## Step 2
## Create the html element 
> This is like the big container that we talked about earlier , then from here we start adding in our container whatever we want 

```html 
<html>
The code goes in here
</html>
```

## Step 3
## Add the head tag
> This is where important meta data ie "al bayanat al Wasfya" alongside other data are declared
> For example setting the encoding of characters which is a good practice 
```html 
<meta charset="utf-8">
```

Also we must add the title tag that has inside of it the title of the page inclosed in the <title> tag

## Step 4
## Body !
The body is where the information presented to the user will show !
