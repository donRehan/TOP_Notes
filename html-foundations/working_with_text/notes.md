# Lesson 1 : Creating paragraphs
To create pagaraphs we use the <p> container tag and add the scentences we want inside of it. 
Otherwise it doesn't get compiled into a set of paragraphs.

## Headings 
Headings like Markdown here are numbered from 1 to 6. Ie h1 to h6 tags

## Strong 
Strong tag ```html <strong> ``` emphasises the word we have in between it in screen readers. And makes text bold in paragraphs.

## Indendation
Children should be indented by two spaces to allow for clear reading
